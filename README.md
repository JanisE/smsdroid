# SMSdroid

SMSdroid is a light and fast app for reading and sending text messages.
It is optimized to play well with any app capable of sending messages.
A good example is [WebSMS](https://github.com/felixb/websms).

## Fork modifications

I've added a feature to select and bulk-delete many threads or conversations (as opposed to 
deleting only one specific conversation or all SMSes on the device, which was already implemented).

## Issues and TODOs

I have no intention on tackling the issues or TODOs I've added to the code in the near future 
and probably ever.
